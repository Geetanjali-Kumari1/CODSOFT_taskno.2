**Task 2 : WordsCounter**

This program prompts the user to enter a text or select a file to count the words. 
It then reads the input text or file and stores it in a string. 
The string is split into an array of words using regular expressions to match whitespace and punctuation. 
A set of stop words is defined to be excluded from the word count. 
The program iterates through the array of words and increments the count of each word in a map, excluding stop words.
The program then computes the total number of words and the number of unique words and displays them to the user. 
If there are any words that appear more than once, the program displays a frequency table.

**Features**
Count the total number of words in the input.
Calculate the number of unique words in the input. 
Exclude common stop words (e.g., "a", "to", "in", "and", etc.) from the word count.

Clone the repository to your local machine.
